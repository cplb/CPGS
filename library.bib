abstract = {In the context of $f(R)$ theories of gravity, we address the problem of finding static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Several aspects of constant curvature solutions with and without electric charge are discussed. We also study the general case (without imposing constant curvature). Following a perturbative approach around the Einstein-Hilbert action, it is found that only solutions of the Schwarzschild-(anti) de Sitter type are present up to second order in perturbations. Explicit expressions for the effective cosmological constant are obtained in terms of the $f(R)$ function. Finally, we have considered the thermodynamics of black holes in anti-de Sitter space-time and found that this kind of solutions can only exist provided the theory satisfies $R_0+f(R_0)<0$. Interestingly, this expression is related to the condition which guarantees the positivity of the effective Newton's constant in this type of theories. In addition, it also ensures that the thermodynamical properties in $f(R)$ gravities are qualitatively similar to those of standard General Relativity.},

@article{Glampedakis2006a,
abstract = {The future LISA detector will constitute the prime instrument for high-precision gravitational wave observations.LISA is expected to provide information for the properties of spacetime in the vicinity of massive black holes which reside in galactic nuclei.Such black holes can capture stellar-mass compact objects, which afterwards slowly inspiral,radiating gravitational waves.The body's orbital motion and the associated waveform carry information about the spacetime metric of the massive black hole,and it is possible to extract this information and experimentally identify (or not!) a Kerr black hole.In this paper we lay the foundations for a practical `spacetime-mapping' framework. Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not necessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is stationary axisymmetric,described by a metric which deviates slightly from the Kerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a `quasi-Kerr' metric by adding to the Kerr metric the deviation in the value of the quadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion in this metric,focusing on equatorial orbits. We proceed by computing `kludge' waveforms which we compare with their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr metric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the waveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an attempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying EMRIs around a non-Kerr object might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number of detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a `confusion' problem, that is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr template of different orbital parameters.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that cosmic acceleration or inflation can be driven by replacing the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity with a function f(R) of the Ricci scalar R. Such f(R) gravity theories have been shown to be equivalent to scalar-tensor theories of gravity that are incompatible with Solar System tests of general relativity, as long as the scalar field propagates over Solar System scales. Specifically, the PPN parameter in the equivalent scalar-tensor theory is gamma=1/2, which is far outside the range allowed by observations. In response to a flurry of papers that questioned the equivalence of f(R) theory to scalar-tensor theories, it was recently shown explicitly, without resorting to the scalar-tensor equivalence, that the vacuum field equations for 1/R gravity around a spherically symmetric mass also yield gamma= 1/2. Here we generalize this analysis to f(R) gravity and enumerate the conditions that, when satisfied by the function f(R), lead to the prediction that gamma=1/2.},

The $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time is a stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically flat exact solution of the vacuum Einstein equations. We compare the associated shadow with the one of Kerr black holes. The shape of the shadow in the $\delta = 2$ Tomimatsu-Sato space-time is oblate and the difference between the two axes can be as high as 6% when viewed on the equatorial plane. We argue that future space sub-mm interferometers (e.g. VSOP-3) may distinguish the two cases, and thus are able to test the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.},

@article{Capozziello2010a,
abstract = {Recently, a strong debate has been pursued about the Newtonian limit (i.e. small velocity and weak field) of fourth order gravity models. According to some authors, the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$-gravity is equivalent to the one of Brans-Dicke gravity with $\omega_{BD} = 0$, so that the PPN parameters of these models turn out to be ill defined. In this paper, we carefully discuss this point considering that fourth order gravity models are dynamically equivalent to the O'Hanlon Lagrangian. This is a special case of scalar-tensor gravity characterized only by self-interaction potential and that, in the Newtonian limit, this implies a non-standard behavior that cannot be compared with the usual PPN limit of General Relativity. The result turns out to be completely different from the one of Brans-Dicke theory and in particular suggests that it is misleading to consider the PPN parameters of this theory with $\omega_{BD} = 0$ in order to characterize the homologous quantities of $f(R)$-gravity. Finally the solutions at Newtonian level, obtained in the Jordan frame for a $f(R)$-gravity, reinterpreted as a scalar-tensor theory, are linked to those in the Einstein frame.},

abstract = {This thesis is devoted to the study of gravitational theories which can be seen as modifications or generalisations of General Relativity. The motivation for considering such theories, stemming from Cosmology, High Energy Physics and Astrophysics is thoroughly discussed (cosmological problems, dark energy and dark matter problems, the lack of success so far in obtaining a successful formulation for Quantum Gravity). The basic principles which a gravitational theory should follow, and their geometrical interpretation, are analysed in a broad perspective which highlights the basic assumptions of General Relativity and suggests possible modifications which might be made. A number of such possible modifications are presented, focusing on certain specific classes of theories: scalar-tensor theories, metric f(R) theories, Palatini f(R) theories, metric-affine f(R) theories and Gauss--Bonnet theories. The characteristics of these theories are fully explored and attention is payed to issues of dynamical equivalence between them. Also, cosmological phenomenology within the realm of each of the theories is discussed and it is shown that they can potentially address the well-known cosmological problems. A number of viability criteria are presented: cosmological observations, Solar System tests, stability criteria, existence of exact solutions for common vacuum or matter configurations etc. Finally, future perspectives in the field of modified gravity are discussed and the possibility for going beyond a trial-and-error approach to modified gravity is explored.},

Thus, we directly constrain noncommutative geometry, a potential grand unified theory of physics, via astrophysical observations.

abstract = {[abridged] Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity is a 4D effective theory that descends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that corrects the Einstein-Hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and the parity-violating, Pontryagin density. In this theory, the gravitational field of spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose multipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l = 4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave emission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black holes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the semi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the massive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a multipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the waveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes to the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating dephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the propagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory. We find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity, the energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the stress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used to describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters, which in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. Gravitational-wave observations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advanced ground detectors or with LISA could use such dephasing to test the dynamical theory to unprecedented levels.},

abstract = {We explore the properties of test-particle orbits in "bumpy" spacetimes - stationary, reflection-symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein equations that have a non-Kerr (anomalous) higher-order multipole-moment structure but can be tuned arbitrarily close to the Kerr metric. Future detectors should observe gravitational waves generated during inspirals of compact objects into supermassive central bodies. If the central body deviates from the Kerr metric, this will manifest itself in the emitted waves. Here, we explore some of the features of orbits in non-Kerr spacetimes that might lead to observable signatures. As a basis for this analysis, we use a family of exact solutions proposed by Manko & Novikov which deviate from the Kerr metric in the quadrupole and higher moments, but we also compare our results to other work in the literature. We examine isolating integrals of the orbits and find that the majority of geodesic orbits have an approximate fourth constant of the motion (in addition to the energy, angular momentum and rest mass) and the resulting orbits are tri-periodic to high precision. We also find that this fourth integral can be lost for certain orbits in some oblately deformed Manko-Novikov spacetimes. However, compact objects will probably not end up on these chaotic orbits in nature. We compute the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and find that the behavior of orbtis near the ISCO can be qualitatively different depending on whether the ISCO is determined by the onset of an instability in the radial or vertical direction. Finally, we compute periapsis and orbital-plane precessions for nearly circular and nearly equatorial orbits in both the strong and weak field, and discuss weak-field precessions for eccentric equatorial orbits.},

@article{Yunes2009a,
abstract = {We consider the concept of fundamental bias in gravitational wave astrophysics as the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity during the entire wave-generation and propagation regime. Such an assumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and observations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where tests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the detection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a mischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source event rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement of waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These parameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates constructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of gravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical principles, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an example, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary coalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular inspiral. The parametrized post-Einsteinian framework should allow matched filtered data to select a specific set of post-Einsteinian parameters without a priori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying general relativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations.},

The bosonic sector of the theory contains a modification to Einstein-Hilbert gravity, involving a nonconformal coupling of curvature to the Higgs field and conformal Weyl term (in addition to a nondynamical topological term). In this paper we derive the weak field limit of this gravitational theory and show that the production and dynamics of gravitational waves are significantly altered. In particular, we show that the graviton contains a massive mode that alters the energy lost to gravitational radiation, in systems with evolving quadrupole moment. We explicitly calculate the general solution and apply it to systems with periodically varying quadrupole moments, focusing in particular on the the well know energy loss formula for circular binaries.},

We show that quadrupole gravitational waves emitted during the tidal disruption process are described reasonable well by a point particle approximation even in the strong encounter case. An additional hydrodynamic calculation based on the Godunov method indicates that shocks develop for sufficiently high tidal compressions. The shock-heating results in an X-ray flare, which for solar-type stars disrupted by 10^6Msun black holes is in the keV range, associated with the gravitational wave signal. The hardness and duration of the X-ray flare may serve as a diagnostic of the mass of the central black hole.},

abstract = {In many astrophysical problems, it is important to understand the behavior of functions that come from rotating (Kerr) black hole orbits. It can be particularly useful to work with the frequency domain representation of those functions, in order to bring out their harmonic dependence upon the fundamental orbital frequencies of Kerr black holes. Although, as has recently been shown by W. Schmidt, such a frequency domain representation must exist, the coupled nature of a black hole orbit's $r$ and $\theta$ motions makes it difficult to construct such a representation in practice. Combining Schmidt's description with a clever choice of timelike coordinate suggested by Y. Mino, we have developed a simple procedure that sidesteps this difficulty. One first Fourier expands all quantities using Mino's time coordinate $\lambda$. In particular, the observer's time $t$ is decomposed with $\lambda$. The frequency domain description is then built from the $\lambda$-Fourier expansion and the expansion of $t$. We have found this procedure to be quite simple to implement, and to be applicable to a wide class of functionals. We test the procedure using a simple test function, and then apply it in a particularly interesting case, the Weyl curvature scalar $\psi_4$ used in black hole perturbation theory.},

abstract = {The Galactic Center is an excellent laboratory for studying phenomena and physical occurring in many other galactic nuclei. The Center of our Milky Way is by far the closest galactic nucleus, and observations with exquisite resolution and sensitivity cover 18 orders of magnitude in energy of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretical simulations have become increasingly more powerful in explaining these measurements. This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the properties of the surrounding dense star cluster. We present the current evidence, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A*, that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4 x 106 M_\odot, beyond any reasonable doubt. We report what is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar mass function. We discuss a dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This 'S-star cluster' appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium 'stellar cusp' around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood 'paradox of youth'. We also summarize more briefly what is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr A* and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

abstract = {A generic class of theories where gravity is mediated by one tensor field together with an arbitrary
 number of scalar fields is considered. The predictions of these theories are worked out in four
 different observationally relevant regimes: (i) quasi-stationary weak fields (solar system
 conditions); (ii) rapidly varying weak fields (gravitational wave experiments); (iii)
 quasi-stationary strong fields (motion of systems of compact bodies, i.e. neutron stars or black
 holes); and (iv) the mixing of strong and radiative field effects in the gravitational radiation of
 N-compact-body systems. Moreover, the authors derive several significant relations between the
 theoretical quantities entering these predictions. They show how strong-field-gravity effects in the
 motion and gravitational radiation of N-compact-body systems can be parametrized by a set of theory
 parameters that generalize the usual post-Newtonian parameters ( gamma , beta ,. . .) introduced in
 the context of quasi-stationary weak gravitational fields. These new parameters ( beta 2 , beta ',
 beta 3 , beta ",. . .) provide a chart for the yet essentially unexplored domain of
 strong-gravitational-field effects, and thereby suggest new directions for testing relativistic
 gravity. This is illustrated by studying in detail a specific two-parameter tensor-bi-scalar theory
 T( beta ', beta ") which has the same post-Newtonian limit as general relativity but leads to new
 nonEinsteinian predictions for the various observables that can be extracted from binary pulsar

abstract = {We present a new approximate method for constructing gravitational radiation driven inspirals of test-bodies orbiting Kerr black holes. Such orbits can be fully described by a semi-latus rectum $p$, an eccentricity $e$, and an inclination angle $\iota$; or, by an energy $E$, an angular momentum component $L_z$, and a third constant $Q$. Our scheme uses expressions that are exact (within an adiabatic approximation) for the rates of change ($\dot{p}$, $\dot{e}$, $\dot{\iota}$) as linear combinations of the fluxes ($\dot{E}$, $\dot{L_z}$, $\dot{Q}$), but uses quadrupole-order formulae for these fluxes. This scheme thus encodes the exact orbital dynamics, augmenting it with approximate radiation reaction. Comparing inspiral trajectories, we find that this approximation agrees well with numerical results for the special cases of eccentric equatorial and circular inclined orbits, far more accurate than corresponding weak-field formulae for ($\dot{p}$, $\dot{e}$, $\dot{\iota}$). We use this technique to study the inspiral of a test-body in inclined, eccentric Kerr orbits. Our results should be useful tools for constructing approximate waveforms that can be used to study data analysis problems for the future LISA gravitational-wave observatory, in lieu of waveforms from more rigorous techniques that are currently under development.},

Unfortunately, the Fisher matrix can be a poor predictor of the amount of information obtained from typical observations, especially for waveforms with several parameters and relatively low expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or for waveforms depending weakly on one or more parameters, when their priors are not taken into proper consideration. In this paper I discuss these pitfalls; show how they occur, even for relatively strong signals, with a commonly used template family for binary-inspiral waveforms; and describe practical recipes to recognize them and cope with them.   Specifically, I answer the following questions: (i) What is the significance of (quasi-)singular Fisher matrices, and how must we deal with them? (ii) When is it necessary to take into account prior probability distributions for the source parameters? (iii) When is the signal-to-noise ratio high enough to believe the Fisher-matrix result? In addition, I provide general expressions for the higher-order, beyond--Fisher-matrix terms in the 1/SNR expansions for the expected parameter accuracies.},

abstract = {We use the dynamical mass measurements of 16 black holes in low-mass X-ray binaries to infer the stellar black hole mass distribution. We find that the observations are best described by a narrow mass distribution at 7.8 +/- 1.2 Msolar. We identify a selection effect related to the choice of targets for optical follow-ups that results in a flux-limited sample. We demonstrate, however, that this selection effect does not introduce a bias in the observed distribution and cannot explain the absence of black holes in the 2-5 solar mass range. On the high mass end, we argue that the rapid decline in the inferred distribution may be the result of the particular evolutionary channel followed by low-mass X-ray binaries. This is consistent with the presence of high-mass black holes in the persistent, high-mass X-ray binary sources. If the paucity of low-mass black holes is caused by a sudden decrease of the supernova explosion energy with increasing progenitor mass, this would have observable implications for ongoing transient surveys that target core-collapse supernovae. Our results also have significant implications for the calculation of event rates from the coalescence of black hole binaries for gravitational wave detectors.},

Specifically, we estimate lower bounds on the coupling parameter \omega of scalar-tensor theories of the Brans-Dicke type and on the Compton wavelength of the graviton \lambda_g in hypothetical massive graviton theories. In these theories, modifications of the gravitational radiation damping formulae or of the propagation of the waves translate into a change in the phase evolution of the observed gravitational waveform. We obtain the bounds through the technique of matched filtering, employing the LISA Sensitivity Curve Generator (SCG), available online. For a neutron star inspiralling into a 10^3 M_sun black hole in the Virgo Cluster, in a two-year integration, we find a lower bound \omega > 3 * 10^5. For lower-mass black holes, the bound could be as large as 2 * 10^6. The bound is independent of LISA arm length, but is inversely proportional to the LISA position noise error. Lower bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength ranging from 10^15 km to 5 * 10^16 km can be obtained from one-year observations of massive binary black hole inspirals at cosmological distances (3 Gpc), for masses ranging from 10^4 to 10^7 M_sun. For the highest-mass systems (10^7 M_sun), the bound is proportional to (LISA arm length)^{1/2} and to (LISA acceleration noise)^{-1/2}. For the others, the bound is independent of these parameters because of the dominance of white-dwarf confusion noise in the relevant part of the frequency spectrum. These bounds improve and extend earlier work which used analytic formulae for the noise curves.},

abstract = {{Extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) have been proposed as a possible source for future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by long-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of a short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent interval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic corrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a geodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in the waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are important depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic EMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately half of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections tend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a Newtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by parameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular importance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter estimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black hole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such dephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive black hole and obtain information about its spin.},

abstract = {Merging compact binaries are currently regarded as the most promising source of gravitational waves for the planned Earth-based LIGO/VIRGO laser-interferometer detector system, and will be an important source also for similar, lower-frequency detectors that might be flown in space (e.g., the proposed LISA mission). During the orbital inspiral, if one or both bodies are rapidly rotating, the general relativistic spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling (i.e., the "dragging of inertial frames" by the bodies' spins) cause the binary's orbital plane to precess. In this paper we analyze the resulting modulation of the inspiral gravitational waveform, using post2-Newtonian equations to describe the precession of the orbital plane, but only the leading-order (Newtonian, quadrupole-moment approximation) equations to describe the orbit, the radiation reaction, the inspiral, and the wave generation. We derive all the formulas one needs to readily compute the spin-modulated gravitational waveform (within the post-Newtonian approximation and the approximation that the precession frequency is much smaller than the orbital frequency). We also develop intuition into what the modulated signals "look like," by a variety of means. We provide approximate, analytical solutions for the precessional motion and the modulated waveforms for two important special cases: the case where the bodies have nearly equal masses and the case where one of the bodies has negligible spin. For these cases, for almost all choices of binary parameters, the motion is a simple precession of the orbital angular momentum around the nearly fixed direction of the total angular momentum, with a few tens of precession periods as the waves sweep through the LIGO/VIRGO observational band. However, when the spin and orbital angular momenta are approximately anti-aligned, there is a transitional-precession epoch during which their near cancellation causes the binary to "lose its gyroscopic bearings" and tumble in space, with a corresponding peculiar sweep of the waveform modulation. We also explore numerically the precessional behaviors that occur for general masses and spins; these typically appear quite similar to our special-case, simple-precession, and transitional-precession solutions. An Appendix develops several diagrammatic aids for understanding intuitively the relation between the precessing orbit and the modulated waveform.},

Among numerous alternatives to Einstein's theory of gravity, theories which include higher order curvature invariants, and specifically the particular class of f(R) theories, have a long history.

We review here f(R) theories of gravity in an attempt to comprehensively present their most important aspects and cover the largest possible portion of the relevant literature.

However, these extreme mass-ratio inspiral sources began in long-period, nearly parabolic orbits that have multiple close encounters with the MBH. The gravitational radiation emitted during these close encounters may be detectable by LISA as a gravitational wave burst if the characteristic passage timescale is less than $10^5$ seconds. Scaling a static, spherical model to the size and mass of the Milky Way bulge we estimate an event rate of $\sim$ 15 per year for such burst signals, detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise greater than five, originating in our galaxy. When extended to include Virgo cluster galaxies our estimate increases to a gravitational wave burst rate of $\sim$ 18. We conclude that these extreme mass-ratio burst sources may be a steady and significant source of gravitational radiation in the LISA data streams.},

In addition to the usual massless excitations of the field, there are now, for general amounts of the two new terms, massive spin-two and massive scalar excitations, with a total of eight degrees of freedom. The massive spin-two part of the field has negative energy. Specific ratios of the two new terms give models with either the massive tensor or the massive scalar missing, with correspondingly fewer degrees of freedom. The static, linearized solutions of the field equations are combinations of Newtonian and Yukawa potentials. Owing to the Yukawa form of the corrections, observational evidence sets only very weak restrictions on the new masses. The acceptable static metric solutions in the full nonlinear theory are regular at the origin. The dynamical content of the linearized field is analyzed by reducing the fourth-order field equations to separated second-order equations, related by coupling to external sources in a fixed ratio. This analysis is carried out into the various helicity components using the transverse-traceless decomposition of the metric.},

The semirelativistic approximation improves upon treatments which use orbits at Newtonian-order and quadrupolar radiation emission, and matches well onto accurate Teukolsky simulations for low eccentricity orbits.

abstract = {The Galactic massive black hole (MBH), with a mass of Mbh=3.6\times10^6 Solar masses, is the closest known MBH, at a distance of only 8 kpc. The proximity of this MBH makes it possible to observe gravitational waves from stars with periapse in the observational frequency window of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This is possible even if the orbit of the star is very eccentric, so that the orbital frequency is many orders of magnitude below the LISA frequency window, as suggested by Rubbo et al. (2006). Here we give an analytical estimate of the detection rate of such gravitational wave bursts. The burst rate is critically sensitive to the inner cut-off of the stellar density profile. Our model accounts for mass-segregation and for the physics determining the inner radius of the cusp, such as stellar collisions, energy dissipation by gravitational wave emission, and consequences of the finite number of stars. We find that stellar black holes have a burst rate of the order of 1 per year, while the rate is of order 0.1 per year for main sequence stars and white dwarfs. These analytical estimates are supported by a series of Monte Carlo samplings of the expected distribution of stars around the Galactic MBH, which yield the full probability distribution for the rates. We estimate that no burst will be observable from the Virgo cluster.},

The corrections, Yukawa and oscillating-like, are found inside and outside the mass distribution. At last when the limit $f\rightarrow R$ is considered the $f(R)$-gravity converges in General Relativity at level of Lagrangian, field equations and their solutions.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting potential sources of gravitational waves for low-frequency, space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is the inspiral of compact objects into massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The detection of waves from such "extreme mass ratio inspiral" systems (EMRIs) and extraction of information from those waves require template waveforms. The systems' extreme mass ratio means that their waveforms can be determined accurately using black hole perturbation theory. Such calculations are computationally very expensive. There is a pressing need for families of approximate waveforms that may be generated cheaply and quickly but which still capture the main features of true waveforms. In this paper, we introduce a family of such "kludge" waveforms and describe ways to generate them. We assess performance of the introduced approximations by comparing "kludge" waveforms to accurate waveforms obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation in the adiabatic limit (neglecting GW backreaction). We find that the kludge waveforms do extremely well at approximating the true gravitational waveform, having overlaps with the Teukolsky waveforms of 95% or higher over most of the parameter space for which comparisons can currently be made. Indeed, we find these kludges to be of such high quality (despite their ease of calculation) that it is possible they may play some role in the final search of LISA data for EMRIs.},

abstract = {A formalism is developed for obtaining approximate gravitational wave solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations of general relativity in situations where the gravitational fields of interest are quite strong. To accomplish this we assume the wave to be of high frequency and expand the vacuum field equations in powers of the correspondingly small wavelength, getting an approximation scheme valid for all orders of 1/r, for arbitrary velocities up to that of light, and for all intensities of the gravitational field. To lowest order in the wavelength, we obtain a gauge-invariant linearized equation for gravitational waves which is just a covariant generalization of that for massless spin-2 fields in a flat background space. This wave equation is solved in the WKB approximation to show that gravitational waves travel on null geodesics of the curved background geometry with their amplitude, frequency, and polarization modified by the curvature of space-time in exact analogy to light waves.},

We think that we have found the right answer to the properly formulated question. We have further developed the field-theoretical formulation of the general relativity which treats gravity as a nonlinear tensor field in flat space-time. The Minkowski metric is a reflection of experimental facts, not a possible choice of the artificial “prior geometry.” In this approach, we have arrived at the gravitational energy-momentum tensor which is (1) derivable from the Lagrangian in a regular prescribed way, (2) a tensor under arbitrary coordinate transformations, (3) symmetric in its components, (4) conserved due to the equations of motion derived from the same Lagrangian, (5) free of the second (highest) derivatives of the field variables, and (6) is unique up to trivial modifications not containing the field variables. There is nothing else, in addition to these six conditions, that one could demand from an energy-momentum object, acceptable both on physical and mathematical grounds. The derived gravitational energy-momentum tensor should be useful in practical applications.},

These results are then applied to a bound system of two point masses moving in elliptical orbits.

abstract = {We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a test-body around a Kerr black hole under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. We have adopted a well established two-step approach: assuming that the particle is moving along a geodesic (justifiable as long as the orbital evolution is adiabatic) we calculate numerically the fluxes of energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity and to the black hole horizon, via the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We can then infer the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum and thus the evolution of the orbit. The orbits are fully described by a semilatus rectum p and an eccentricity e. We find that while, during the inspiral, e decreases until shortly before the orbit reaches the separatrix of stable bound orbits [which is defined by ps(e)], in many astrophysically relevant cases the eccentricity will still be significant in the last stages of the inspiral. In addition, when a critical value pcrit(e) is reached, the eccentricity begins to increase as a result of continued radiation induced inspiral. The two values ps, pcrit (for given e) move closer to each other, in coordinate terms, as the black hole spin is increased, as they do also for fixed spin and increasing eccentricity. Of particular interest are moderate and high eccentricity orbits around rapidly spinning black holes, with p(e)≈ps(e). We call these “zoom-whirl” orbits, because of their characteristic behavior involving several revolutions around the central body near periastron. Gravitational waveforms produced by such orbits are calculated and shown to have a very particular signature. Such signals may well prove of considerable astrophysical importance for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna detector.},

Strangely, this is precisely the relation among mass moments enforced by the no-hair theorems of rotating black holes. By contrast, if Newtonian gravity is supplemented by a multipolar gravitomagnetic field, whose leading term represents frame-dragging (or if the electrostatic field is supplemented by a multipolar magnetic field), we are unable to find an analogous Carter-like constant.

We go beyond the previously discussed linearization of the field equations to consider the lowest-order nonlinearities. These are shown to provide a natural, gauge-invariant, averaged stress tensor for the effective energy localized in the high-frequency gravitational waves. Under the assumption of the WKB form for the field, this stress tensor is found to have the same algebraic structure as that for an electromagnetic null field. A Poynting vector is used to investigate the flow of energy and momentum by gravitational waves, and it is seen that high-frequency waves propagate along null hypersurfaces and are not backscattered by the lowest-order nonlinearities. Expressions for the total energy and momentum carried by the field to flat null infinity are given in terms of coordinate-independent hypersurface integrals valid within regions of high field strength. The formalism is applied to the case of spherical gravitational waves where a news function is obtained and where the source is found to lose exactly the energy and momentum contained in the radiation field. Second-order terms in the metric are found to be finite and free of divergences of the (lnr)/r variety.},

abstract = {Captures of stellar-mass compact objects (COs) by massive ($\sim 10^6 M_\odot$) black holes (MBHs) are potentially an important source for LISA, the proposed space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector. The orbits of the inspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up until the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion precession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The strongest capture signals will be $\sim$10 times weaker than LISA's instrumental noise, but in principle (with sufficient computing power) they can be disentangled from the noise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in hand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA launches. Here we introduce a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) capture waveforms, given in (nearly) analytic form, for use in advancing LISA studies until more accurate versions are available. Our model waveforms include most of the key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of capture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the MBH's spin). Here we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative contributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total signal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which LISA will be able to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured waveform. For a typical source (a $10 M_\odot$ CO captured by a $10^6 M_\odot$ MBH at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30), we find that LISA can determine the MBH and CO masses to within a fractional error of $\sim 10^{-4}$, measure $S/M^2$ (where $S$ and $M$ are the MBH's mass and spin) to within $\sim 10^{-4}$, and determine the sky location of the source to within $\sim 10^{-3}$ stradians.},

abstract = {The Kerr family of solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations is the most general class of solutions known at present which could represent the field of a rotating neutral or electrically charged body in asymptotically flat space. When the charge and specific angular momentum are small compared with the mass, the part of the manifold which is stationary in the strict sense is incomplete at a Killing horizon. Analytically extended manifolds are constructed in order to remove this incompleteness. Some general methods for the analysis of causal behavior are described and applied. It is shown that in all except the spherically symmetric cases there is nontrivial causality violation, i.e., there are closed timelike lines which are not removable by taking a covering space; moreover, when the charge or angular momentum is so large that there are no Killing horizons, this causality violation is of the most flagrant possible kind in that it is possible to connect any event to any other by a future-directed timelike line. Although the symmetries provide only three constants of the motion, a fourth one turns out to be obtainable from the unexpected separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, with the result that the equations, not only of geodesics but also of charged-particle orbits, can be integrated completely in terms of explicit quadratures. This makes it possible to prove that in the extended manifolds all geodesics which do not reach the central ring singularities are complete, and also that those timelike or null geodesics which do reach the singularities are entirely confined to the equator, with the further restriction, in the charged case, that they be null with a certain uniquely determined direction. The physical significance of these results is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in center of the Milky Way using high resolution NIR techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of 300 microarcsecond, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allow us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single point mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now 6 times better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31 +- 0.06|stat +- 0.36|R0) * 10^6 M_sun where the fractional statistical error of 1.5 percent is nearly independent from R0 and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic Center is R0 = 8.33 +- 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value is systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 +- 0.06) * 10^6 M_sun * (R0/8kpc)^2.19. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

We strongly constrain non-dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity with a timelike Chern-Simons scalar through observations of the double binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B. We first calculate Chern-Simons corrections to the orbital evolution of binary systems. We find that the ratio of the correction to periastron precession to the general relativistic prediction scales quadratically with the semi-major axis and inversely with the square of the object's radius. Binary pulsar systems are thus ideal to test this theory, since periastron precession can be measured with sub-degree accuracies and the semi-major axis is millions of times larger than the stellar radius. Using data from PSR J0737-3039A/B we dramatically constrain the non-dynamical Chern-Simons coupling to $M_{\CS} := 1/|\dot{\vartheta}| > 33 {\textrm{meV}}$, approximately a hundred billion times better than current Solar System tests.},

abstract = {As massive black holes (MBHs) grow from lower-mass seeds, it is natural to expect that a leftover population of progenitor MBHs should also exist in the present universe. Dwarf galaxies undergo a quiet merger history, and as a result, we expect that dwarfs observed in the local Universe retain some `memory' of the original seed mass distribution. Consequently, the properties of MBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies may provide clean indicators of the efficiency of MBH formation. In order to examine the properties of MBHs in dwarf galaxies, we evolve different MBH populations within a Milky Way halo from high-redshift to today. We consider two plausible MBH formation mechanisms: `massive seeds' formed via gas-dynamical instabilities and a Population III remnant seed model. `Massive seeds' have larger masses than PopIII remnants, but form in rarer hosts. We dynamically evolve all halos merging with the central system, taking into consideration how the interaction modifies the satellites, stripping their outer mass layers. We compute different properties of the MBH population hosted in these satellites. We find that for the most part MBHs retain the original mass, thus providing a clear indication of what the properties of the seeds were. We derive the black hole occupation fraction (BHOF) of the satellite population at z=0. MBHs generated as `massive seeds' have large masses that would favour their identification, but their typical BHOF is always below 40 per cent and decreases to less than per cent for observed dwarf galaxy sizes. In contrast, Population III remnants have a higher BHOF, but their masses have not grown much since formation, inhibiting their detection.},

These instrumental sensitivities are often depicted (after averaging over source position and polarization) by graphing the minimal values of the gravitational wave amplitude detectable by the instrument versus the frequency of the gravitational wave. This paper describes in detail how to compute such a sensitivity curve given a set of specifications for a spaceborne laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory. Minor errors in the prior literature are corrected, and the first (mostly) analytic calculation of the gravitational wave transfer function is presented. Example sensitivity curve calculations are presented for the proposed LISA interferometer. We find that previous treatments of LISA have underestimated its sensitivity by a factor of $\sqrt{3}$.},

abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, all astrophysical black holes are fully described by their masses and spins. This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of black holes. In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework that allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a function of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a black hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected Kerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate depending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there is a ring-like structure around the black-hole shadow with a diameter of about 10 black-hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of the underlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical details of accretion flow models. We show that the shape of this ring depends directly on the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used for an independent measurement of all three parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that this ring is highly circular for a Kerr black hole with a spin a<0.9M, independent of the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical and asymmetric if the no-hair theorem is violated. Near-future very-long baseline interferometric observations of Sgr A* will image this ring and may allow for an observational test of the no-hair theorem.},

This means that one can still predict the future outside the event horizon. A black hole on a spacelike surface is defined to be a connected component of the region of the surface bounded by the event horizon. As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes.},

abstract = {The spin and quadrupole moment of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center can in principle be measured via astrometric monitoring of stars orbiting at milliparsec (mpc) distances, allowing tests of general relativistic "no-hair" theorems (Will 2008). One complicating factor is the presence of perturbations from other stars, which may induce orbital precession of the same order of magnitude as that due to general relativistic effects. The expected number of stars in this region is small enough that full N-body simulations can be carried out. We present the results of a comprehensive set of such simulations, which include a post-Newtonian treatment of spin-orbit effects. A number of possible models for the distribution of stars and stellar remnants are considered. We find that stellar perturbations are likely to obscure the signal due to frame-dragging for stars beyond $\sim$0.5 mpc from the black hole, while measurement of the quadrupole moment is likely to require observation of stars inside $\sim$0.2 mpc. A high fraction of stellar remnants, e.g. 10-Solar-mass black holes, in this region would make tests of GR problematic at all radii. We discuss the possibility of separating the effects of stellar perturbations from those due to GR.},

@article{Thorne1980,
abstract = {This paper brings together, into a single unified notation, the multipole formalisms for gravitational radiation which various people have constructed. It also extends the results of previous workers. More specifically:Part One of this paper reviews the various scalar, vector, and tensor spherical harmonics used in the general relativity literature—including the Regge-Wheeler harmonics, the symmetric, trace-free ("STF") tensors of Sachs and Pirani, the Newman-Penrose spin-weighted harmonics, and the Mathews-Zerilli Clebsch-Gordan-coupled harmonics—which include "pure-orbital" harmonics and "pure-spin" harmonics. The relationships between the various harmonics are presented. Part One then turns attention to gravitational radiation. The concept of "local wave zone" is introduced to facilitate a clean separation of "wave generation" from "wave propagation." The generic radiation field in the local wave zone is decomposed into multipole components. The energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum in the waves are expressed as infinite sums of multipole contributions. Attention is then restricted to sources that admit a nonsingular, spacetime-covering de Donder coordinate system. (This excludes black holes.) In such a coordinate system the multipole moments of the radiation field are expressed as volume integrals over the source. For slow-motion systems, these source integrals are re-expressed as infinite power series in L/$\lambda$≡(size of source )/(reduced wavelength of waves ). The slow-motion source integrals are then specialized to systems with weak internal gravity to yield (i) the standard Newtonian formulas for the multipole moments, (ii) the post-Newtonian formulas of Epstein and Wagoner, and (iii) post-post-Newtonian formulas.Part Two of this paper derives a multipole-moment wave-generation formalism for slow-motion systems with arbitrarily strong internal gravity, including systems that cannot be covered by de Donder coordinates. In this formalism one calculates, by any means, the source's instantaneous, near-zone, external gravitational field as a solution of the time-independent Einstein field equations. One then reads off of this near-zone field the source's instantaneous multipole moments; and one plugs those time-evolving moments into the standard radiation formulae given in Part One of this paper.As building blocks for this formalism, Part Two also does the following things: (1) In the linearized theory of gravity, for the vacuum exterior of an isolated system, it derives the general solution of the field equations (a result due to Sachs, Bergmann, and Pirani). (2) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum near-zone exterior of an isolated system, it derives the structure of the general solution of the Einstein field equations. That structure is expressed as a sum of products of multipole contributions. It also matches this near-zone field onto an outgoing-wave radiation field. (3) In full nonlinear general relativity, for the vacuum exterior of a stationary isolated system, (a) it presents a definition of multipole moments which meshes naturally with gravitational-wave theory; (b) it introduces the concept of "asymptotically Cartesian and mass centered" (ACMC) coordinate systems; and (c) it shows how to deduce the multipole moments of a source from the form of its metric in an ACMC coordinate system. As an example, the lowest few (l≤3) multipole moments of the Kerr metric are computed.},

We develop a formalism that yields the mean-square amplitudes and surface velocities of global normal modes excited in such a way. The isotropic elastic sphere model of a star is adopted to demonstrate this formalism and for calculative simplicity. It is shown that gravitational waves solely couple to quadrupolar spheroidal eigenmodes and that normal modes are only sensitive to the spherical component of the gravitational waves having the same azimuthal order. The mean-square amplitudes in case of stationary external gravitational waves are given by a simple expression, a product of a factor depending on the resonant properties of the star and the power spectral density of the gravitational waves' spherical accelerations. Both mean-square amplitudes and surface velocities show a characteristic R^8-dependence (effective R^2-dependence) on the radius of the star. This finding increases the relevance of this excitation mechanism in case of stars larger than the Sun.},

Colliding galaxies have central black holes that sink to the center of the merged galaxy and begin to orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Some galaxy evolution models predict that the binary black hole system will enter the LISA band with significant orbital eccentricity, while other models suggest that the orbits will already have circularized. Using a full seventeen parameter waveform model that includes the effects of orbital eccentricity, spin precession and higher harmonics, we investigate how well the source parameters can be inferred from simulated LISA data. Defining the reference eccentricity as the value one year before merger, we find that for typical LISA sources, it will be possible to measure the eccentricity to an accuracy of parts in a thousand. The accuracy with which the eccentricity can be measured depends only very weakly on the eccentricity, making it possible to distinguish circular orbits from those with very small eccentricities. LISA measurements of the orbital eccentricity can provide strong constraints on theories of galaxy mergers in the early universe.},

Simulations of stellar clusters designed to study this problem typically rely on simple treatments of the black hole encounter which neglect some important features of orbits around black holes, such as the minimum radii of stable, non-plunging orbits. Incorporating an accurate representation of the orbital dynamics near a black hole has been avoided due to the large computational overhead. This paper provides new, more accurate, expressions for the energy and angular momentum lost by a compact object during a parabolic encounter with a non-spinning black hole, and the subsequent inspiral lifetime. These results improve on the Keplerian expressions which are now commonly used and will allow efficient computational simulations to be performed that account for the relativistic nature of the spacetime around the central black hole in the system.},

@article{Gair2006a,
abstract = {We present an improved version of the approximate scheme for generating inspirals of test-bodies into a Kerr black hole recently developed by Glampedakis, Hughes and Kennefick. Their original "hybrid" scheme was based on combining exact relativistic expressions for the evolution of the orbital elements (the semi-latus rectum p and eccentricity e) with approximate, weak-field, formula for the energy and angular momentum fluxes, amended by the assumption of constant inclination angle, iota, during the inspiral. Despite the fact that the resulting inspirals were overall well-behaved, certain pathologies remained for orbits in the strong field regime and for orbits which are nearly circular and/or nearly polar. In this paper we eliminate these problems by incorporating an array of improvements in the approximate fluxes. Firstly, we add certain corrections which ensure the correct behaviour of the fluxes in the limit of vanishing eccentricity and/or 90 degrees inclination. Secondly, we use higher order post-Newtonian formulae, adapted for generic orbits. Thirdly, we drop the assumption of constant inclination. Instead, we first evolve the Carter constant by means of an approximate post-Newtonian expression and subsequently extract the evolution of iota. Finally, we improve the evolution of circular orbits by using fits to the angular momentum and inclination evolution determined by Teukolsky based calculations. As an application of the improved scheme we provide a sample of generic Kerr inspirals and for the specific case of nearly circular orbits we locate the critical radius where orbits begin to decircularise under radiation reaction. These easy-to-generate inspirals should become a useful tool for exploring LISA data analysis issues and may ultimately play a role in source detection.},

An additional divergence appears when infrared photons or gravitons are emitted from noninfrared external lines of zero mass, but it is proved that for infrared gravitons this divergence cancels in the sum of all such diagrams. (The cancellation does not occur in massless electrodynamics.) The formula derived for graviton bremsstrahlung is then used to estimate the gravitational radiation emitted during thermal collisions in the sun, and we find this to be a stronger source of gravitational radiation (though still very weak) than classical sources such as planetary motion. We also verify the conjecture of Dalitz that divergences in the Coulomb-scattering Born series may be summed to an innocuous phase factor, and we show how this result may be extended to processes involving arbitrary numbers of relativistic or nonrelativistic particles with arbitrary spin.},

abstract = {The S stars orbiting the Galactic center black hole reach speeds of up to a few percent the speed of light during pericenter passage. This makes, for example, S2 at pericenter much more relativistic than known binary pulsars, and opens up new possibilities for testing general relativity. This paper develops a technique for fitting nearly-Keplerian orbits with perturbations from Schwarzschild curvature, frame dragging, and spin-induced torque, to redshift measurements distributed along the orbit but concentrated around pericenter. Both orbital and light-path effects are taken into account. It turns out that absolute calibration of rest-frame frequency is not required. Hence, if pulsars on orbits similar to the S stars are discovered, the technique described here can be applied without change, allowing the much greater accuracies of pulsar timing to be taken advantage of. For example, pulse timing of 3 microsec over one hour amounts to an effective redshift precision of 30 cm/s, enough to measure frame dragging and the quadrupole moment from an S2-like orbit, provided problems like the Newtonian "foreground" due to other masses can be overcome. On the other hand, if stars with orbital periods of order a month are discovered, the same could be accomplished with stellar spectroscopy from the E-ELT at the level of 1 km/s.},

For our purpose it suffices to take into account up to quadratic terms in the expansion of $f(R)$, thus we can approximate $f(R) = R + aR^2$ with a positive dimensional parameter $a$. In the non-relativistic limit, we get an additional Yukawa correction with coupling strength $G/3$ and Compton wave length $\sqrt{6a}$ to the Newtonian potential, which is a known result in the literature. As an application, we derive to the same order the correction to the geodetic precession of a gyroscope in a gravitational field and the precession of binary pulsars. The result of the Gravity Probe B experiment yields the limit $a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{11} \, \mathrm{m}^2$, whereas for the pulsar B in the PSR J0737-3039 system we get a bound which is about $10^4$ times larger. On the other hand the E\"ot-Wash experiment provides the best laboratory bound $a \lesssim 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}^2$. Although the former bounds from geodesic precession are much larger than the laboratory ones, they are still meaningful in the case some type of chameleon effect is present and thus the effective values could be different at different length scales.},

In this paper, it is shown that, in general, f(R) theories of gravity produce a third massive polarization of gravitational waves and the primordial production of this polarization is analyzed adapting the adiabatically-amplified zero-point fluctuations process at this case. In this way, previous results, where only particular cases of f(R) theories have been analyzed, will be generalized. The presence of the mass could also have important applications in cosmology, because the fact that gravitational waves can have mass could give a contribution to the dark matter of the Universe. An upper bound for these relic gravitational waves, which arises from the WMAP constrains, is also mentioned. At the end of the paper, the potential detection of such massive gravitational waves using interferometers like Virgo and LIGO is discussed.},

However we think that metric-affine gravity deserves much more attention than that related to cosmological applications and so we consider here metric-affine gravity theories in which the gravitational action is a general function of the scalar curvature while the matter action is allowed to depend also on the connection which is not {\em a priori} symmetric. This general treatment will allow us to address several open issues such as: the relation between metric-affine $f(R)$ gravity and General Relativity (in vacuum as well as in the presence of matter), the implications of the dependence (or independence) of the matter action on the connections, the origin and role of torsion and the viability of the minimal-coupling principle.},

 received considerable attention, mainly due to its interesting applications in cosmology. However,
 the phenomenology of such theories is not only relevant to cosmological scales, especially when it
 is treated within the framework of the so called Palatini variation, an independent variation with
 respect to the metric and the connection, which is not considered a priori to be the Levi–Civita
 connection of the metric. If this connection has its standard geometrical meaning the resulting
 theory will be a metric-affine theory of gravity, as will be discussed in this talk. The general
 formalism will be presented and several aspects of the theory will be covered, mainly focusing on
 the enriched phenomenology that such theories exhibit with respect to General Relativity, relevant
 not only to large scales (cosmology) but also to small scales (e.g. torsion).},

abstract = {The gravitational waves, emitted by a compact object orbiting a much more massive central body, depend on the central body’s spacetime geometry. This paper is a first attempt to explore that dependence. For simplicity, the central body is assumed to be stationary, axially symmetric (but rotating), and reflection symmetric through an equatorial plane, so its (vacuum) spacetime geometry is fully characterized by two families of scalar multipole moments Ml and Sl with l=0,1,2,3,..., and it is assumed not to absorb any orbital energy (e.g., via waves going down a horizon or via tidal heating). Also for simplicity, the orbit is assumed to lie in the body’s equatorial plane and to be circular, except for a gradual shrinkage due to radiative energy loss. For this idealized situation, it is shown that several features of the emitted waves carry, encoded within themselves, the values of all the body’s multipole moments Ml, Sl (and thus, also the details of its full spacetime geometry). In particular, the body’s moments are encoded in the time evolution of the waves’ phase $\Phi$(t) (the quantity that can be measurd with extremely high accuracy by interferometric gravitational-wave detectors), and they are also encoded in the gravitational-wave spectrum $\Delta$E(f) (energy emitted per unit logarithmic frequency interval). If the orbit is slightly elliptical, the moments are also encoded in the evolution of its periastron precession frequency as a function of wave frequency, $\Omega$$\rho$(f); if the orbit is slightly inclined to the body’s equatorial plane, then they are encoded in its inclinational precession frequency as a function of wave frequency, $\Omega$z(f). Explicit algorithms are derived for deducing the moments from $\Delta$E(f), $\Omega$$\rho$(f), and $\Omega$z(f). However, to deduce the moments explicitly from the (more accurately measurable) phase evolution $\Phi$(t) will require a very difficult, explicit analysis of the wave generation process—a task far beyond the scope of this paper.},

Horava's model, and its variants, show dramatically improved ultra-violet behaviour at the cost of exhibiting violation of Lorentz invariance at ultra-high momenta. Following up on our earlier note, [arXiv:0904.4464 [hep-th]], we discuss in more detail our variant of Horava's model. In contrast to Horava's original model, we abandon "detailed balance" and restore parity invariance. We retain, however, Horava's "projectability condition" and explore its implications. Under these conditions, we explicitly exhibit the most general model, and extract the full classical equations of motion in ADM form. We analyze both spin-2 and spin-0 graviton propagators around flat Minkowski space. We furthermore analyze the classical evolution of FLRW cosmologies in this model, demonstrating that the higher-derivative spatial curvature terms can be used to mimic radiation fluid and stiff matter. We conclude with some observations concerning future prospects.},

By detecting those waves and extracting from them the central body’s lowest few moments, gravitational-wave detectors have the potential to test the black-hole no-hair theorem and search for exotic objects such as naked singularities and boson or soliton stars. This paper estimates how accurately we can expect to measure the central body’s moments. The measurement errors are estimated using a combination of, first, the leading-order (of a post-Newtonian series) contribution of each moment to the gravitational-wave phase, second, an a priori probability distribution that constrains each moment’s magnitude to a range appropriate for a compact body, and third, any relations that the multipole moments satisfy among themselves, which reduce the number of degrees of freedom for the waves (this is useful in cases when one is searching for a specific type of compact body). We find that the Earth-based LIGO detector cannot provide sufficiently precise measurements of enough multipole moments to search for exotic objects, but the space-based LISA detector can do so.},

abstract = {An almost brief, though lengthy, review introduction about the long history of higher order gravities and their applications, as employed in the literature, is provided. We review the analogous procedure between higher order gravities and GR, as described in our previous works, in order to highlight its important achievements. Amongst which are presentation of an easy classification of higher order Lagrangians and its employment as a \emph{criteria} in order to distinguish correct metric theories of gravity. For example, it does not permit the inclusion of only one of the second order Lagrangians in \emph{isolation}. But, it does allow the inclusion of the cosmological term. We also discuss on the compatibility of our procedure and the Mach idea. We derive a dimensional dependent version of Duff's trace anomaly relation, which in \emph{four}-dimension is the same as the usual Duff relation. The Lanczos Lagrangian satisfies this new constraint in \emph{any} dimension. The square of the Weyl tensor identically satisfies it independent of dimension, however, this Lagrangian satisfies the previous relation only in three and four dimensions.},

abstract = {In Einstein's gravitational theory, the spacetime is Riemannian, that is, it has vanishing torsion and vanishing nonmetricity (covariant derivative of the metric). In the gauging of the general affine group A(4, R) and of its subgroup GL(4, R) in four dimensions, energy-momentum and hypermomentum currents of matter are canonically coupled to the coframe and to the connection of a metric-affine spacetime with nonvanishing torsion and nonmetricity, respectively. Fermionic matter can be described in this framework by half-integer representations of the 
 covering subgroup. We set up a (first-order) Lagrangian formalism and build up the corresponding Noether machinery. For an arbitrary gauge Lagrangian, the three gauge field equations come out in a suggestive Yang-Mills like form. The conservation-type differential identities for energy-momentum and hypermomentum and the corresponding complexes and superpotentials are derived. Limiting cases such as the Einstein-Cartan theory are discussed. In particular we show, how the A(4, R) may “break down” to the Poincar\'{e} (inhomogeneous Lorentz) group. In this context, we present explicit models for a symmetry breakdown in the cases of the Weyl (or homothetic) group, the SL(4, R), or the GL(4, R).},

abstract = {The cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational energy of accreting matter into radiation. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*, where strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5 mm and 7 mm have detected intrinsic structure in Sgr A*, but the spatial resolution of observations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm that set a size of 37(+16)(-10) microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of Sgr A*. This is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of Sgr A* emission may not be centred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.},

This framework proposes to enhance the amplitude and phase of gravitational waveform templates through post-Einsteinian parameters to search for generic deviations from General Relativity in gravitational wave data. Such enhancements interpolate between General Relativity and alternative theory predictions, but their magnitude must be such as to satisfy all current experiments and observations. The data that currently constrains the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework the most is the orbital period decay of binary pulsars. We use such observations to place upper limits on the magnitude of post-Einsteinian parameters, which will be critical when gravitational waves are detected and this framework is implemented.},

@article{Doeleman2009,
abstract = {A long standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the event horizon. Realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of General Relativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at the edge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental black hole physics (e.g., spin). Steady long-term progress on improving the capability of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at short wavelengths has now made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the next decade. The most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by 1.3mm VLBI of Schwarzschild radius scale structure in SgrA*, the compact source of radio, submm, NIR and xrays at the center of the Milky Way. SgrA* is thought to mark the position of a $\sim$4 million solar mass black hole, and because of its proximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon size of any black hole candidate in the Universe. Over the next decade, existing and planned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, high angular resolution "Event Horizon Telescope" that will bring us as close to the edge of black hole as we will come for decades. This white paper describes the science case for mm/submm VLBI observations of both SgrA* and M87 (a radio loud AGN of a much more luminous class that SgrA*). We emphasize that while there is development and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, and the recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that would normally be associated with such an ambitious project.},

 quantities, the mass and the spin. In this series of papers, we investigate a framework for testing
 the no-hair theorem with observations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum. We formulate
 our approach in terms of a parametric spacetime which contains a quadrupole moment that is
 independent of both mass and spin. If the no-hair theorem is correct, then any deviation of the
 black hole quadrupole moment from its Kerr value has to be zero. We analyze in detail the properties
 of this quasi-Kerr spacetime that are critical to interpreting observations of black holes and
 demonstrate their dependence on the spin and quadrupole moment. In particular, we show that the
 location of the innermost stable circular orbit and the gravitational lensing experienced by photons
 are affected significantly at even modest deviations of the quadrupole moment from the value
 predicted by the no-hair theorem. We argue that observations of black hole images, of
 relativistically broadened iron lines, as well as of thermal X-ray spectra from accreting black
 holes will lead in the near future to an experimental test of the no-hair theorem.},

abstract = {The merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars should produce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of general relativity. A reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in the Galaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectors will be successful in detecting such bursts. Present estimates of this rate are rather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries with merger times less than the age of the Universe. Here we report the discovery of a 22-ms pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativistic double-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. This system will merge in about 85 Myr, a time much shorter than for any other known neutron-star binary. Together with the relatively low radio luminosity of PSR J0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in the predicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our Galaxy (and in the rest of the Universe).},

  20 April 2004, is a landmark physics experiment in space to test two fundamental predictions of Einstein’s general relativity
  theory, the geodetic and frame-dragging effects, by means of cryogenic gyroscopes in Earth orbit. Data collection began 28
  August 2004 and science operations were completed 29 September 2005. The data analysis has proven deeper than expected as
  a result of two mutually reinforcing complications in gyroscope performance: (1)&nbsp;a changing polhode path affecting the calibration
  of the gyroscope scale factor C
  
  g
   against the aberration of starlight and (2)&nbsp;two larger than expected manifestations of a Newtonian gyro torque due to patch
  potentials on the rotor and housing. In earlier papers, we reported two methods, ‘geometric’ and ‘algebraic’, for identifying
  and removing the first Newtonian effect (‘misalignment torque’), and also a preliminary method of treating the second (‘roll-polhode
  resonance torque’). Central to the progress in both torque modeling and C
  
  g
   determination has been an extended effort on “Trapped Flux Mapping” commenced in November 2006. A turning point came in August
  2008 when it became possible to include a detailed history of the resonance torques into the computation. The East-West (frame-dragging)
  effect is now plainly visible in the processed data. The current statistical uncertainty from an analysis of 155&nbsp;days of data is 5.4 marc-s/yr (∼14% of the predicted effect), though it must be emphasized that this
  is a preliminary result requiring rigorous investigation of systematics by methods discussed in the accompanying paper by
  Muhlfelder et al. A&nbsp;covariance analysis incorporating models of the patch effect torques indicates that a 3–5% determination

Our analysis also reveals that gravitational waves in the modified theory travel at the speed of light in Minkowski spacetime. However, on a Schwarzschild background the characteristic speed of propagation along a given direction splits into two modes, one subluminal and one superluminal. The width of the splitting depends on the azimuthal components of the propagation vector, is linearly proportional to the mass of the black hole, and decreases with the third inverse power of the distance from the black hole. Radial propagation is unaffected, implying that as probed by gravitational waves the location of the event horizon of the spacetime is unaltered. The analysis further reveals that when a high frequency, pure gravitational wave is scattered from a black hole, a scalar wave of comparable amplitude is excited, and vice-versa.},

The position of Sgr A* has been determined to within 10 mas on infrared images. To this accuracy, the gravitational source (sensed by stellar orbits) and the radiative source (Sgr A*) are coincident. Proper motions of four stars measured both in the infrared and radio indicate that the central star cluster moves with Sgr A* to within 70 km s-1. Finally, combining stellar orbital information with an upper limit of 8 km s -1 for the intrinsic proper motion of Sgr A* (perpendicular to the Galactic plane), we place a lower limit on the mass of Sgr A* of 4 × 105 M&odot;.},

 strong evidence for a dark mass of 2.5 × 10 6 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]

 High angular resolution measurements at radio wavelengths find a compact radio source, Sagittarius
 (Sgr) A*, that is either the faint glow from a small amount of material accreting onto the hole with
 low radiative efficiency or a miniature active galactic nucleus (AGN) core-jet system. This paper
 provides a full report on the first program that has measured the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*
 with respect to background extragalactic reference frame. Our current result is

 The observations were obtained with the NRAO Very Large Array at 4.9 GHz over 16 yr. The proper
 motion of Sgr A* provides an estimate of its mass based on equipartition of kinetic energy between
 the hole and the surrounding stars. The measured motion is largest in galactic longitude. This
 component of the motion is consistent with the secular parallax that results from the rotation of
 the solar system about the center, which is a global measure of the difference between Oort's
 constants ( A - B ), with no additional peculiar motion of Sgr A*. The current uncertainty in Oort's
 galactic rotation constants limits the use of this component of the proper motion for a mass
 inference. In latitude, we find a small, and weakly significant, peculiar motion of Sgr A*, -19 ± 7
 km s -1 after correction for the motion of the solar system with respect to the local standard of
 rest. We consider sources of peculiar motion of Sgr A* ranging from unstable radio wave propagation
 through intervening turbulent plasma to the effects of asymmetric masses in the center. These fail
 to account for a significant peculiar motion. One can appeal to an m = 1 dynamical instability that
 numerical simulations have revealed. However, the measurement of a latitude peculiar proper motion
 of comparable magnitude and error but with opposite sign in the companion paper by Reid leads us to
 conclude at the present time that our errors may be underestimated and that the actual peculiar
 motion might therefore be closer to zero. Improvement of these measurements with further
 observations and resolving the differences between independent experiments will provide the
 accuracies of a few km s -1 in both coordinates that will provide both a black hole mass estimate
 and a definitive determination of Oort's galactic rotation constants on a global Galactic scale.},

@article{King2008,
abstract = {Observations show that the central black hole in galaxies has a mass M of only $\sim$10-3 of the stellar bulge mass. Thus, whatever process grows the black hole also promotes star formation with far higher efficiency. We interpret this in terms of the generic tendency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion discs to become self-gravitating outside some small radius Rsg $\sim$ 0.01-0.1 pc from the black hole. We argue that mergers consist of sequences of such episodes, each limited by self-gravity to a mass $\Delta$Mepisode $\sim$ 10-3 M, with angular momentum characteristic of the small part of the accretion flow which formed it. In this picture, a major merger with $\Delta$Mmerger $\sim$ M gives rise to a long series of low-mass accretion disc episodes, all chaotically oriented with respect to one another. Thus, the angular momentum vector oscillates randomly during the accretion process, on mass-scales $\sim$ 103 times smaller than the total mass accreted in a major merger event.  We show that for essentially all AGN parameters, the disc produced by any accretion episode of this type has lower angular momentum than the hole, allowing stable co- and counter-alignment of the discs through the Lense-Thirring effect. A sequence of randomly oriented accretion episodes as envisaged above then produces accretion discs stably co- or counter-aligned with the black hole spin with almost equal frequency. Accretion from these discs very rapidly adjusts the hole's spin parameter to average values (the precise range depending slightly on the disc vertical viscosity coefficient $\alpha$2) from any initial conditions, but with significant fluctuations ($\Delta$a $\sim$ +/-0.2) about these. We conclude that (i) supermassive black holes (SMBH) should on average spin moderately, with the mean value decreasing slowly as the mass increases; (ii) SMBH coalescences leave little long-term effect on ; (iii) SMBH coalescence products in general have modest recoil velocities, so that there is little likelihood of their being ejected from the host galaxy; (iv) black holes can grow even from stellar masses to $\sim$5 × 109Msolar at high redshift z $\sim$ 6; and (v) jets produced in successive accretion episodes can have similar directions, but after several episodes the jet direction deviates significantly. Rare examples of massive holes with larger spin parameters could result from prograde coalescences with SMBHs of similar mass, and are most likely to be found in giant ellipticals. We compare these results with observation.},

abstract = {The latest version of the planetary part of the numerical ephemerides EPM (Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon) developed at the Institute of Applied Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences is presented. The ephemerides of planets and the Moon were constructed by numerical integration in the post-Newtonian metric over a 140-year interval (from 1880 to 2020). The dynamical model of EPM2004 ephemerides includes the mutual perturbations from major planets and the Moon computed in terms of General Relativity with allowance for effects due to lunar physical libration, perturbations from 301 big asteroids, and dynamic perturbations due to the solar oblateness and the massive asteroid ring with uniform mass distribution in the plane of the ecliptic. The EPM2004 ephemerides resulted from a least-squares adjustment to more than 317000 position observations (1913–2003) of various types, including radiometric measurements of planets and spacecraft, CCD astrometric observations of the outer planets and their satellites, and meridian and photographic observations. The high-precision ephemerides constructed made it possible to determine, from modern radiometric measurements, a wide range of astrometric constants, including the astronomical unit AU = (149597870.6960 ± 0.0001) km, parameters of the rotation of Mars, the masses of the biggest asteroids, the solar quadrupole moment J2 = (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10-7, and the parameters of the PPN formalism \ss and ?. Also given is a brief summary of the available state-of-the-art ephemerides with the same precision: various versions of EPM and DE ephemerides from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (USA) and the recent versions of these ephemerides—EPM2004 and DE410—are compared.

We then review many exact and approximate vacuum solutions of the modified theory, and discuss possible matter couplings. Following this, we review the myriad astrophysical, solar system, gravitational wave and cosmological probes that bound Chern–Simons modified gravity, including discussions of cosmic baryon asymmetry and inflation.

abstract = {According to general relativity, photons are deflected and delayed by the curvature of space-time produced by any mass. The bending and delay are proportional to gamma + 1, where the parameter gamma is unity in general relativity but zero in the newtonian model of gravity. The quantity gamma - 1 measures the degree to which gravity is not a purely geometric effect and is affected by other fields; such fields may have strongly influenced the early Universe, but would have now weakened so as to produce tiny--but still detectable--effects. Several experiments have confirmed to an accuracy of approximately 0.1% the predictions for the deflection and delay of photons produced by the Sun. Here we report a measurement of the frequency shift of radio photons to and from the Cassini spacecraft as they passed near the Sun. Our result, gamma = 1 + (2.1 +/- 2.3) x 10(-5), agrees with the predictions of standard general relativity with a sensitivity that approaches the level at which, theoretically, deviations are expected in some cosmological models.},

LIGO will support studies concerning the nature and nonlinear dynamics of gravity, the structures of black holes, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. It will also measure the masses, birth rates, collisions, and distributions of black holes and neutron stars in the universe and probe the cores of supernovae and the very early universe. The technology for LIGO has been developed during the past 20 years. Construction will begin in 1992, and under the present schedule, LIGO's gravitational-wave searches will begin in 1998.},

 frequency range from a few Hz to a few kHz. After the end of the first science run, partially
 overlapped with the LIGO fifth science run, the detector underwent several upgrades to improve its
 sensitivity. The second Virgo science run started at the beginning of July 2009 in coincidence with
 LIGO. A further upgrade is planned at beginning of 2010 with the installation of new suspensions for

abstract = {Black hole event horizons, causally separating the external universe from compact regions of
 spacetime, are one of the most exotic predictions of general relativity. Until recently, their
 compact size has prevented efforts to study them directly. Here we show that recent millimeter and
 infrared observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the
 Milky Way, all but require the existence of a horizon. Specifically, we show that these observations
 limit the luminosity of any putative visible compact emitting region to below 0.4% of Sgr A*'s
 accretion luminosity. Equivalently, this requires the efficiency of converting the gravitational
 binding energy liberated during accretion into radiation and kinetic outflows to be greater than
 99.6%, considerably larger than those implicated in Sgr A*, and therefore inconsistent with the
 existence of such a visible region. Finally, since we are able to frame this argument entirely in
 terms of observable quantities, our results apply to all geometric theories of gravity that admit
 stationary solutions, including the commonly discussed f ( R ) class of theories.},

abstract = {Frequency-domain filters for time-windowed gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries are constructed which combine the excellent performance of our previously developed time-domain P approximants with the analytic convenience of the stationary phase approximation without a serious loss in event rate. These Fourier-domain representations incorporate the “edge oscillations” due to the (assumed) abrupt shutoff of the time-domain signal caused by the relativistic plunge at the last stable orbit. These new analytic approximations, the SPP approximants, are not only effectual for detection and faithful for parameter estimation, but are also computationally inexpensive to generate (and are faster by factors up to 10, as compared to the corresponding time-domain templates). The SPP approximants should provide data analysts the Fourier-domain templates for massive black hole binaries of total mass m≲40M⊙, the most likely sources for LIGO and VIRGO.},

@article{Vigeland2010,
abstract = {General relativity predicts the existence of black holes, compact objects whose spacetimes depend on only their mass and spin (the famous "no hair" theorem). As various observations probe deeper into the strong fields of black hole candidates, it is becoming possible to test this prediction. Previous work suggested that such tests can be performed by measuring whether the multipolar structure of black hole candidates has the form that general relativity demands, and introduced a family of "bumpy black hole" spacetimes to be used for making these measurements. These spacetimes are black holes with the "wrong" multipoles, where the deviation from general relativity depends on the spacetime's "bumpiness." In this paper, we show how to compute the Geroch-Hansen moments of a bumpy black hole, demonstrating that there is a clean mapping between the deviations used in the bumpy black hole formalism and the Geroch-Hansen moments. We also extend our previous results to define bumpy black holes whose {\it current} moments, analogous to magnetic moments of electrodynamics, deviate from the canonical Kerr value.},

We confirm that while this does not solve the fundamental issue of why the cosmological constant has the value it has, it is indeed a viable theory that resolves the problem of the discrepancy between the vacuum energy density and the observed value of the cosmological constant. We also point out that this proposal may have a valid quantum field theory basis in terms of a spin-2 field theory for the graviton interaction with matter.},

@article{Vitagliano2010,
abstract = {Metric-affine theories of gravity provide an interesting alternative to General Relativity: in such an approach, the metric and the affine (not necessarily symmetric) connection are independent quantities. Furthermore, the action should include covariant derivatives of the matter fields, with the covariant derivative naturally defined using the independent connection. As a result, in metric-affine theories a direct coupling involving matter and connection is also present. The role and the dynamics of the connection in such theories is explored. We employ power counting in order to construct the most general action and search for the minimal requirements it should satisfy for the connection to be dynamical. We find that for the most general action containing lower order invariants the independent connection does not carry any dynamics. It actually reduces to the role of an auxiliary field and can be completely eliminated algebraically in favour of the metric and the matter field, introducing extra interactions with respect to general relativity. However, we also show that including higher order terms in the action radically changes this picture and excites new degrees of freedom in the connection, making it (or parts of it) dynamical. Constructing actions that constitute exceptions to this rule requires significant fine tuned and/or extra {\em a priori} constraints on the connection. We also consider f(R) actions as a particular example in order to show that they constitute a distinct class of metric-affine theories with special properties, and as such they cannot be used as representative toy theories to study the properties of metric-affine gravity.},
